Run invoice server on 3001
Run this on 3000

And you can see how the login/logout work with next js
And you can also see how fetches work

Check network tab to see connect.sid after logging in etc.

Files of interest:
    next.config.mjs (for process.env setup to work on front end (default is only server has access))

Note after redirected to "dashboard" go back to the root at localhost:3000 to test the fetch and logout
